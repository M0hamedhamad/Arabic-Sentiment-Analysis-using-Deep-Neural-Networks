# Arabic Sentiment Analysis using Deep Neural Networks

## Introduction
This project is part of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course at Ain Shams University. Our aim is to leverage deep learning techniques to analyze sentiment in Arabic text. We focus on training various deep neural network models to accurately classify and understand the sentiment behind Arabic language content.

## Objectives
- To develop and train diverse Deep Neural Network models for sentiment analysis in Arabic text.
- Participation in a Kaggle competition to benchmark our models against real-world data.
- Improvement of model accuracy and understanding of neural network behaviors in natural language processing.

## Methodology
We employed several neural network architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and transformers. Our methodology included:
- Data preprocessing and tokenization for Arabic text.
- Training and tuning different models to find the optimal configuration.
- Analyzing model performance and making iterative improvements.

## Conclusion
This project not only allowed us to deeply explore neural networks in NLP but also gave us valuable insights into handling linguistic nuances in Arabic. We believe our findings and methodologies can contribute significantly to the field of NLP.
